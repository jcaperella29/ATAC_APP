# 🔬 ATAC-seq Peak Annotation & Enrichment Viewer

This interactive **R Shiny** app allows you to upload **MACS2 `.narrowPeak`** files, annotate peaks using **ChIPseeker**, and visualize functional enrichment with **enrichR** — all without touching a single line of R.

💡 Built with love in R, glowy CSS, and battle-tested on real-world ATAC-seq data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Upload MACS2 `.narrowPeak` files
- 🧬 Annotate peaks via `ChIPseeker`
- 📊 Visualize annotation (tables, pie charts)
- 🧠 Run functional enrichment (GO, KEGG, Reactome via `enrichR`)
- 📦 Fully containerized via Docker (no Shiny Server needed)
- 🖥️ HPC/local compatible — cloud optional

---

## 📦 Requirements (if running outside Docker)

Install the required R packages manually:
```r
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "shinyjs", "plotly", "DT", "enrichR", "clusterProfiler"
))
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly=TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c(
  "ChIPseeker", "GenomicRanges", "TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.knownGene",
  "org.Hs.eg.db"
))

🧪 How to Run the App
🔁 Option 1: Local (with Docker)
type bash in your terminal  then run:

git clone https://github.com/your-user/ATAC_APP.git
cd ATAC_APP
bash run.sh
Open in browser: http://localhost:8787


This launches the app via Docker — no setup needed.

💻 Option 2: Local (RStudio)


# From inside R
setwd("path/to/ATAC_APP")
library(shiny)
runApp(".")

🧠 FAQ
Q: Why isn’t this deployed on the cloud?
A: This app uses Bioconductor packages (e.g., Rhtslib, ChIPseeker, TxDb) that require native compilation and large genomic data libraries. These do not play well with serverless environments like Cloud Run, but work great on Docker/HPC setups.

Q: Can I run this on an HPC?
✅ Yes. This app is fully portable via Docker or Singularity.
